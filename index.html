        <h3><b>BACKGROUND</b></h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Czechia, or the Czech Republic, is a country in Central Europe that
          has a very rich educational history. The Czech Republic recognized the
          importance of education and instituted educational policies as early
          as 1774 when they mandated school attendance. This has resulted in
          Czechia having a great modern day literacy rate of over 99%. For
          comparison, 79% of adults are literate in the United States.
          <br /><br />
          As of today, the Czechian Government guarantees that all children will
          have access to at least one year of preschool, as well as nine years
          of elementary education from grades 1-9, split into five years of
          primary education and four years of secondary education. After that,
          children can choose to go into specialized vocational education or
          general secondary education, and then test into university through a
          "Maturita Exam".
          <br /><br />
          Czechia has great benefits for students such as free state-provided
          health care and free tuition at many native universities, although
          ones that teach in foreign languages may not be free.

        <h3><b>THE PROBLEM IN TEACHING</b></h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          While the overall educational conditions are good for students in the
          Czech Republic and the Czech Republic puts a lot of focus on
          education, teachers are not viewed in a highly reputable manner and
          are not treated as well, which has resulted in disparities within how
          teachers are treated in Czechia as opposed to in other similar Europen
          countries.
          <br /><br />
          <i
            >Only 53% of secondary teachers in the Czech Republic believe that
            the advantages of teaching outweigh the disadvantages, which is the
            lowest rate out of all OECD countries.</i
          >

          <br /><br />
          <b>1. BENEFITS</b><br />
          Teachers are being paid below the OECD average for salary.
