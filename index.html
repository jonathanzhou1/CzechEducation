          <h3><b>BACKGROUND</b></h3>
          <p>
            Czechia, or the Czech Republic, is a country in Central Europe that
            has a very rich educational history. The Czech Republic recognized the
            importance of education and instituted educational policies as early
            as 1774 when they mandated school attendance. This has resulted in
            Czechia having a great modern day literacy rate of over 99%. For
            comparison, 79% of adults are literate in the United States.
            <br /><br />
            As of today, the Czechian Government guarantees that all children will
            have access to at least one year of preschool, as well as nine years
            of elementary education from grades 1-9, split into five years of
            primary education and four years of secondary education. After that,
            children can choose to go into specialized vocational education or
            general secondary education, and then test into university through a
            "Maturita Exam".
            <br /><br />
            Czechia has great benefits for students such as free state-provided
            health care and free tuition at many native universities, although
            ones that teach in foreign languages may not be free.

        <h3><b>THE PROBLEM IN TEACHING</b></h3>
        <p>
          While the overall educational conditions are good for students in the
          Czech Republic and the Czech Republic puts a lot of focus on
          education, teachers are not viewed in a highly reputable manner and
          are not treated as well, which has resulted in disparities within how
          teachers are treated in Czechia as opposed to in other similar Europen
          countries.
          <br /><br />
          According to the Global Teacher Status Index 2018, the Czech Republic
          has the sixth lowest teacher appreciation rating out of polled
          countries.
          <br /><br />

          <br />
          Only <i>53%</i> of secondary teachers in the Czech Republic believe
          that the advantages of teaching outweigh the disadvantages, which is
          the <b>lowest</b>
          rate out of all OECD countries. This is likely for many of the reasons
          listed below:

          <b>1. BENEFITS</b>
          <br />
          Teachers are being paid below the OECD average for salary.

        <h3><b>POLICIES</b></h3>
        <p>
          Through recent years, the Czech Republic has recognized many of these
          issues for teachers and has started to implement policies to try to
          alleviate teacher stress and improve compensation.
        </p>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 2vh;"><b>Specific Policy Reference:</b></h4>
        <p>
          The Long-term Plan for Education and the Development of the Education System 
          of the Czech Republic (2019-2023) within the Government Resolution No. 489 
          was approved in July 2019.
          <br><br>
          The key strategic goals are to:
          <ul>
            <li>increasing financial means for teachers</li>
            <li>revise curriculum and support innovated education frameworks</li>
            <li>improve management of schools and school facilities through cooperation between levels of governance</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4><b>Results of Policy:</b></h4>
        <p>
          Since 2020, the Czech government has made increasing teacher salaries
          a priority within its main Education Strategy, and has already implemented a
          policy to increase teacher salaries by 15%. There are also additional policies 
          implemented to support teacher interactions with students by adding more 
          protections and training teachers in the cases of students aggression, 
          Additionally, the government is continuing to push for even more changes.
          <br><br>
          <b>According to the Czech government's policy statement, the government has commited to:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintaining teacher salaries at 130% of the average gross monthly salary.</li>
            <li>Improving the conditions of teaching by increasing professional support</li>
            <li>Reform teacher training with more emphasis on practical skills</li>
            <li>Make teaching positions more accessible by 2024</li>
            <li>Strengthening the roles of school principals</li>
            <li>Renovate and construct new education infastructure</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4><b>Policy Analysis:</b></h4>
        <p>
          These policies, if implemented successfully in a manner that will reach the goals listed,
          are a great first step towards addressing the issues listed above. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Increasing the roles
              of principals and administrative staff within schools should reduce the stress teachers
              face from administrative work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increasing teacher salaries and guaranteeing a baseline
              minimum pay relative to average salaries will improve teachers' perceptions of their 
              value within society and will also hopefully add security to their lives and improve their
              living conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reforming teaching positions with more emphasis on practical skills
              should prepare teachers with more skills to deal with aggressive students who are unwilling
              to listen.
            </li>
          </ul>
          In addition to these improvements, I would recommend implementing a policy similar to California's
          AB-238 Bill proposed in 2023-2024 Regular Session. This bill focuses on establishing Student Teacher
          Support Programs with grants in order to improve teacher retention and recruitment.
          <br><br>
          Often times, policies implemented to help teachers are not broad enough to reach many groups of teachers
          who may need it most. Student teachers and teaching assistants are often some groups that are neglected, 
          making much less salary than established teachers. The unsustainability of being a student teacher can be a significant barrier for
          people who wish to become teachers and for people who wish to get more experience teaching in a guided setting.
          Implementing a bill like California's AB-238 would enable student teachers in Czechia to be supported more by
          grants on top of whatever salary they are potentially paid, which would hopefully make becoming a teacher more
          accessible to all.
          <br><br>
          Not only would this help the student teachers themselves, but this would also improve the overall pool of
          teachers in the Czech Republic. If we provide more support for those who may wish to become teachers,
          but haven't considered it a feasible career because of the low initial pay, then we can improve where the 
          system is bottlenecked and hopefully improve the entire teaching pool, which will then have a positive impact
          on students and their learning.
